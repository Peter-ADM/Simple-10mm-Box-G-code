I Beleive that an Additive Manufacture and a regular 3D printing user can slove many of their problems by simply 
learning G-code. G-code is basically the answers to a textbook. One can learn why there is a small gap in their print by reading the 
G-code. G-code may seem overwhelming at first but it's very repetative which makes it quite easy to learn. G-code is also used for 
milling and CNC machines. Overall i feel that G-code can help you understand many of your problems with your machine in a half a 
hour which is much faster than re-slicing your model hoping that it changes the quality of your print.
